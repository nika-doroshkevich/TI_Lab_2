# My second lab for the subject "Information theory" :closed_lock_with_key:

:mortar_board: I did this lab in the second year of university in the fourth semester.

:computer: This program was written using Visual Studio 2019, Windows Forms (for GUI), .NET Core 3.1, __C#__.

### What did I do in this lab :question:

This is my software implementation of streaming cipher

- Polynomial degree = 36
- Polynomial = x^36 + x^11 + 1 (the polynomial is given by the sequence of 0 and 1)
- Starting value is also given by the sequence of 0 and 1, must be 36 (polynomial degree) in length.
